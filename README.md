# health-tracker-app

Health Tracker is a full-stack web application built using C#, .NET 6, Angular and TypeScript. It enables users to track their health-related data, including nutrition and exercise. The application provides an intuitive user interface for logging and visualizing health data, as well as features for setting goals, generating reports and more.

**Why I used the technologies**

As a full-stack software engineer, I have chosen to specialise in .NET and Angular technologies. This decision stems from my desire to gain comprehensive knowledge and expertise in these technologies, and personal projects provide an excellent opportunity for hands-on experience. By utilizing these technologies, I can enhance my skills and proficiency in their development.

Furthermore, the decision to use .NET and Angular is supported by the fact that both frameworks have large and active communities. These communities offer extensive documentation, resources, and a vibrant ecosystem. As an active member of these communities, I aim to stay updated with the latest industry trends and best practices through this project.

Additionally, the scalability and performance capabilities of .NET and C# make them suitable choices for the health tracker application. These technologies offer features such as just-in-time compilation, efficient memory management, and performance optimizations. Leveraging these capabilities ensures that the application can handle high traffic, process data efficiently, and provide a seamless user experience.

Overall, my choice to utilize .NET and Angular technologies for this project serves the purpose of personal growth, staying connected to the community, and leveraging the performance and scalability benefits these technologies offer.
